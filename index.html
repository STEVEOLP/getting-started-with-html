<h1><b>KEY POINTS FROM LESSON 1</b></h1>
<b>Different ways of thinking</b>
<p>1.Procedural thinking - Creating perfectly clear and ambiguous instructions for a computer to follow. 
  <br>2.Abstract - Finding similarity or generality amongst seemingly different things. 
  (Avoid unnecessary repitition)<br>3.Systems thinking - break a big problem down into smaller pieces.
<br>4.Computer Empathy - The ability to understand what a computer is, how it works, and what it's good and bad at doing. 
<br>5.Debugging - Systematic process of relentlessly identifying the cause of a computer program that doesn't work. (Bug* = mistake somewhere in the computer code"
and every programmer has a system for fixing them, they would collect evidence, generate theories, test those theories and fix the problem)

<b>World Wide Web (A Collection of HTML Documents)</b>
<p><em>HTML</em> = Hypertext Markup Language and it is the basis for almost every webpage.
</p>
<b>Major Pieces: </b><br>1.HTTP: Main protocol of the web.<br>2.Servers: Computers that host the files that make up the web.<br>3.Internet: Worlds largest computer
network. <br>4.Browser: A program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web.<br>
<b><br>HTML is made up of</b></b>: <br>-Text content
(what you see)<br>-Markup (what it looks like)
<br>-references to other documents.<br>
-links to other pages <a href="https://www.dontdronemebro.com">This website is the best podcast in the universe.</a><br>
-This link is also helpful!! <a href="www.udacity.com/html_playground">HTML PLAYGROUND</a><br>
</b><br>
<p><b>HTML MARKUP:</b><br><br>
Made up of tags,<b> b(bold)</b>, <em>em(italic)</em>,<br> br(break), a(anchor) opening and closing for each!<br>
A href is an attribute name, the value is the website you are making the link and the content seen above HTML PLAYGROUND is the actual link to the value.
<br>
- Always remember that void tags don't  require a closing tag. <br>
<br>
<b>Images tag (img tag)</b>
img src= "url" or alt="text" alt(alternate) src (source)<br>
- A google search for adding links in html will always help you out!
